<!-- Button for calling skype user... "echo123" is the skype user name, in this case
it's the call test service :) it has to be replaced by proper rizzoma user name -->

<!-- script for checking if skype is available, you could include on the page
but it is not necessary! this will display warning if you click skype button and don't have skype
installed. this is its only function! calling by clicking on the button also works without this script!
Not sure if including it once on the page is enough, but i would guess so :) including for every
button sounds unlikely to me :) -->
